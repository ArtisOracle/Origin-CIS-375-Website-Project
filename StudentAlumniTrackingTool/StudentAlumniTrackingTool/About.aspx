<p>
        Thanks for visiting Student Alumni Tracker! This is an implementation of a 
        student-alumni tracking tool created for a winter 2012 CIS 375 Software 
        Engineering class at the University of Michigan - Dearborn.&nbsp; Copyright (C)

                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>
                The problem given is to develop a student/alumni tracking tool. The goal of of this tool is to allow students and alumni
                 of colleges and universities to enter data about themselves - data such as degree(s), major(s), minor(s), schools attended,
                  employers, contact info, etc. - and receive information about other students or alumni with similar characteristics.
</p><p>
Deliverables of this project include a front-end Web interface with forms for users to interact with.  Specifically, the front-end Web interface
 will specify features relevant to a tracking tool including add, search, delete and management of student/alumni records. A back-end server is
  used to compute results based upon user input from the front-end and communicate them back.
</p><p>
Resources demanded by this project are listed here and are broken into people and technological requirements. People requirements include
 project planners, documentation writers, developers, testers, and hosting managers. Technological resources required include a Web-hosting 
 server for displaying graphical content (GUI) thus providing an interface between the user and the back-end. The server must support .NET
  technologies (used extensively in this project for front- and back- end).  Finally, a database is required for storing user data.
